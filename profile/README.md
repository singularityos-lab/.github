### **Singularity OS - Vision and Development Approach**  

Singularity OS is an ever-evolving operating system. Everything can change at any time, but always with the goal of maintaining a seamless user experience. It is based on Vanilla OS but differs in being a rolling releaseâ€”there are no declared versions, updates simply arrive when they are ready.  

When I say **"everything can change"**, I mean everything, including the fact that it is based on Vanilla OS. However, it includes the full core stack of Vanilla OS, such as **abroot, apx, vso**, and more.  

### **Community Participation & Project Direction**  

The community is welcome to join discussions, suggest features, and provide feedback. However, **Singularity OS follows my personal vision of development**. While I value input, final decisions will be made based on my direction and experimentation.  

I encourage constructive discussions, but:  
- Suggestions are considered, not guaranteed to be implemented.  
- Persistent insistence on changes will not be entertained.  
- Discussions that become repetitive or overly insistent will be closed immediately.  

This project is a space for experimentation, and contributions should align with its philosophy. By participating, you acknowledge and respect these principles.
